           <!-- <div class="font-medium">Interest and Early Career</div>
            <div>I have been using computers since my 5th standard. I am very passionate about the various software and technologies. I spent most of my time learning different technologies. During my ninth standard, I started to program with visual basic. I then learnt C, C++ ,JAVA ,HTML from class 10 to 12 . I also showed great interest in physics, science, and engineering. </div>
            <div>For my college and degree, I have chosen engineering in Instrumentation and Control Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. But I will be graduating with a minor degree in computer science, which comprises of courses like Data structures and algorithm, DBMS, Operating system, Networking and Cloud computing, which further helped me to learn more about my Interests and fuel my passion in this field.</div>
            <div class="font-medium mt-10 mb-2">Design and Software</div>
            <div> Academics aside, I started with android development as a hobby to design and develop mobile software. I spent my first few semesters learning android app development. It covered basic app development from scratch, final few topics about user interface and experience, and android material design vs. flat. I then switched from programming to User experience and design. I developed a few apps from tutorials. On the other hand, before diving into developing my own application of interest, I needed to design my own splash screen and different assets. So, I took a course to learn Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD where I can create and design my own assets for my app to prototype. This then played a huge part in joining Graphique (  design club of our college) and other design teams. I had developed a simple app to store class timetables, which was my first ever app made for my classmates. This was made with assets, screens, everything which was designed in Adobe illustrator. During the Summer of 2019, I spent 2 whole months extending my timetable app to a more dynamic one. One can store attendance, arrange timetables, and share the attendance status on social media.</div>
            <div>I had collaborated with one other student of my college coding club to develop this app. We completed it, and then it was published on the Google play store. It was 2 months of work, where we added features by the side and designed all interfaces on our own.</div>-->
            <div class="font-medium mt-10 mb-2">First Internship Experience at Indian Startup - Trawello Healthcare</div>
            <div>In the December of 2019, I had landed a winter internship at a start-up founded by college alumni, Trawello Healthcare service Pvt Ltd. as an android app developer. They hired me as a developer to work on an android app to display the reports of their customers. They gave me full freedom in designing it and I took this chance to develop my design skills to make the app aesthetically more pleasing . The project has been completed, and the app's beta version is available in the google play store for testing.</div>
            <div class="font-medium mt-10 mb-2">SDE , Airbus Group, India (Internship)</div>
            <div>We worked in a dedicative Agile-based team - Identity Access Management, a self-service team where complete development of digital products occurs end to end. I learned and worked in frontend using Angular, fixing UIs, bugs and consuming APIs.</div>
            <div class="font-medium mt-10 mb-2">Software Engineer and Designer at Startup</div>
            <div>Jun  2022, Joined a US-based startup as Software Engineer (Frontend) and UI Designer, which is now under stealth/building mode. We are a team of 12 members  working on the product. I am working on v1 product design ( Web SAAS Product ) and complete development in the frontend. </div>
